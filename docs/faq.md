## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why did my schedule fail to sync to my calendar with EKError Code 17?
- TK Schedule will only create and delete events on a calendar named "UAL Instructor Schedule for Uxxxxxx" where "xxxxxx" represents the six digits of your file number so that I can't possibly be responsible for your other calendars becoming corrupted.
- TK Schedule tries to create its calendar on the source you specify in Settings > Calendar (e.g. iCloud, Google, etc.)
- Sometimes the source doesn't allow TK Schedule to create a calendar. In my testing, iCloud generally allows calendar creation while Google does not.
- As a workaround, you can try to create a calendar on your source of choice with the exact name listed above. Once you create the calendar, open Apple's Calendar app and tap "Calendars" on the bottom of the screen. You should see your newly created calendar populate here.
- In TK Schedule, go to Settings > Calendar. Select your calendar source and you should see a calendar associated with that source in the section below.
- Try to sync your saved schedule again.

### How do I share the iCloud calendar TKSchedule created?
- Read this [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/share-icloud-calendars-iph7613c4fb/ios) page.
- On your device, in the shared calendar settings, turn off Allow Editing. This way your family members can't change your schedule.
- Instruct the calendar recipient to turn off Show Changes in their shared calendar settings. This is to prevent the recipient from getting up to 30 calendar change notifications every time you download a new version of your schedule.
