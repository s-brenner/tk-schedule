# Privacy Policy

TK Schedule is owned, operated, and maintained by Scott Brenner (“me”). Scott Brenner respects your right to privacy and shares your concern about the security of any data you may submit via my mobile application (“TK Schedule”, or the “app”) or through its web site (the “site”), currently accessible at [https://s-brenner.github.io/tk-schedule/](https://s-brenner.github.io/tk-schedule).

Your privacy is critically important to me. I don’t want to be a creepy stalker or evil spammer. I have a few fundamental principles:

* I don’t ask you for personal information unless I truly need it.
* I don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop my products, or protect my rights.
* I don’t store personal information on my servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of my services.
The following statement discloses the guidelines Scott Brenner has established for protecting the information you provide to me during your visit to the site and while using the app.

## Aggregated Statistics

I may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to my website and users of the app. For example, I may aggregate anonymous usage data to publish a report on trends in the usage of Atlas Winds.

## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Scott Brenner collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. My purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how my visitors use the site.

## Email Communications

If you choose to stop receiving emails regarding TK Schedule, please follow the unsubscribe instructions within each email communication or send an email to [brenner.scott.980@icloud.com](mailto:brenner.scott.980@icloud.com). I will not provide or share any mailing lists or other information about you to another company or service for promotional purposes.

Any service-related emails (help requests, feedback, etc.) generally do not offer an option to unsubscribe as they are necessary to provide the service you requested.

## Data Security

TK Schedule uses industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to allow for the encryption of personal and location information during transmissions to our servers.

I restrict access to data to my employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve the app. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline if they fail to meet those obligations.

## Children

I do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13 and do not target our websites to children under 13. If you are under thirteen, please do not submit any data through the app or site.

I encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our privacy policy by instructing their children to never provide personal data through any of our app or site without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personal data to me, please contact me, and I will endeavor to delete that information from my servers.

## Exclusions

This privacy policy does not apply to any unsolicited information you provide to me, such as feature requests and feedback sent via our support channels. All unsolicited information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and I shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute such unsolicited information to others without limitation or attribution.

## Disclaimer

While I continue to work hard to protect your data, no transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure, and I cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Scott Brenner. Transmitting personal information is done at your own risk.

## Privacy Policy Changes

If Scott Brenner makes changes to any terms or conditions of this privacy policy, these changes will be posted on the site in a timely manner. I reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently. In case of a business transaction in which a portion or all of Scott Brenner's business is acquired, I will notify you as described above in this paragraph.

## Contact Me

If you have any additional questions or concerns about this policy or our information practices, please feel free to contact me at any time at [brenner.scott.980@icloud.com](mailto:brenner.scott.980@icloud.com).
