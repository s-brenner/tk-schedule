## Welcome to Atlas Winds

Atlas Winds is designed for Atlas Air pilots to easily calculate the landing wind additive in accordance with company guidance. [Download Atlas Winds](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/atlas-winds/id1458439441) if you hate public math too.

### Features
- Calculate approach wind additives for 737, 747, 767 and 777
- Input the wind in knots or meters per second

### Data Entry Methods
- If online, select the airport, download current METAR and TAF, select the wind, and finally select the landing runway
- Manually enter the runway heading, wind direction, wind speed, and wind gust
